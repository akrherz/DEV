27 Jan 2017, Rod provided a listing of variables he is interested in

- MaxTAloft
- MaxTwAloft
- MinTAloft "this is looking for cold layer below the warm layer"
- MinTwAloft "this is looking for cold layer below the warm layer"
- ProbRefreeze
- ColdLayerDepth
- WarmLayerDepth "depth of warm layer aloft > 0C"
- ProbIcePresent

Do we want RH% at location of Max/Min T/Tw aloft?
