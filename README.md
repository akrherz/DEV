# akrherz's DEV Stuff

Nothing too exciting to see here as this is just a random collection of odds
and ends, a bunch of one-off scripts that are more one-off than my typical code
projects.

The folder names used here somewhat match [other repos](https://github.com/akrherz)
that I have.

Everything you see is Apache 2 licensed or whatever license makes you happy :)
